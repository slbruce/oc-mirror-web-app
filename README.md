# OC Mirror v2 Web Application

A modern web-based interface for managing OpenShift Container Platform mirroring operations using oc-mirror v2. This application provides a user-friendly way to create, manage, and execute mirror configurations without requiring command-line expertise.

**Current Version: v3.1.1**

## 🚀 Quick Start (Containerized - No Host Dependencies)

The easiest way to run this application is using containers. This approach requires **no installation** of Node.js, oc, or oc-mirror on your host system.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** OR **Podman** (choose one!)
- **OpenShift pull-secret.json** (required to connect to Red Hat registries)

> **Note:** You must provide a valid `pull-secret.json` file (downloadable from https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads#tool-pull-secret) in order to mirror images from Red Hat registries.

### 1. Clone and Navigate

```bash
cd oc-mirror-web-app
```

### 2. Run with Container Script (Recommended)

> **🚨 IMPORTANT: First Run Requirement** 🚨
> 
> **For your first run, you MUST use the `--fetch-catalogs` flag to download operator catalogs:**
> 
> ```bash
> # Make the script executable
> chmod +x container-run.sh
> 
> # ⭐ FIRST RUN: Build and run with catalog fetching (REQUIRED)
> ./container-run.sh --fetch-catalogs
> ```
> 
> **Why is this important?**
> - The `--fetch-catalogs` flag downloads real operator catalog data for all OCP versions (4.15-4.19)
> - **Without this flag, the application will not work properly** - it requires the catalog data to function
> - This ensures you have access to the complete list of operators and their channels
> - Subsequent runs can use `./container-run.sh` (without the flag) for faster startup

The script automatically detects whether you have Docker or Podman and uses the appropriate one.

The script will:
- ✅ Detect your container runtime (Docker or Podman)
- ✅ Check container runtime availability
- ✅ Create necessary data directories
- ✅ Build the container image (includes oc and oc-mirror v2)
- ✅ Start the containerized application with optimized settings
- ✅ Display access information

### 3. Access the Application

Once running, access the web interface at:
- **Web UI**: http://localhost:3000
- **API**: http://localhost:3001

### Container Management

```bash
# View logs
./container-run.sh --logs

# Stop the application
./container-run.sh --stop

# Build image only
./container-run.sh --build-only

# Run container only (assumes image exists)
./container-run.sh --run-only

# Check which container engine is detected
./container-run.sh --engine

# Build with catalog fetching (complete data, slower build)
./container-run.sh --fetch-catalogs

# Build without fetching catalogs (fast build, uses fallback data)
./container-run.sh
```

The container now includes:
- **Multi-architecture support** for AMD64 and ARM64
- **Optimized environment variables** for better performance
- **Enhanced logging** with configurable log levels
- **Improved caching** for OC Mirror operations
- **Better error handling** and health checks
- **Pre-fetched operator catalogs** for OCP versions 4.15-4.19 (faster operator selection)
- **Multi-format catalog processing** for complete operator coverage
- **Automatic architecture detection** and display in system status

### Operator Catalog Fetching

The application now pre-fetches operator catalogs for all supported OCP versions (4.15-4.19) during the build process. This provides:

- **Faster operator selection** - No need to query catalogs at runtime
- **Version-specific channels** - Each OCP version has its own operator catalog
- **Offline capability** - Works without internet access after build
- **Accurate channel information** - Real catalog data instead of static fallbacks
- **Enhanced compatibility** - Supports multiple catalog formats including index.yaml

**Build Options:**
- **Default (Fast)**: No catalog fetch (uses fallback data, builds in 2-3 minutes)
- **Complete build**: Use `--fetch-catalogs` flag (takes 5-10 minutes, provides complete data)

**Supported Catalogs:**
- Red Hat Operator Index
- Certified Operator Index  
- Community Operator Index

**Catalog Processing:**
- **Multi-format support**: Handles catalog.json, index.json, index.yaml, package.json, and YAML formats
- **Robust extraction**: Gracefully handles non-standard operator structures
- **Complete coverage**: Processes all operators including edge cases like lightspeed-operator

### Alternative: Quay.io Images (quay-run.sh)

For production deployments using pre-built images from Quay.io:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x quay-run.sh

# Start the application from Quay.io
./quay-run.sh

# View logs
./quay-run.sh --logs

# Stop the application
./quay-run.sh --stop

# Show status
./quay-run.sh --status

# Restart the application
./quay-run.sh --restart
```

### Alternative: Podman Compose

If you prefer using compose with Podman:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x podman-compose.sh

# Start with podman-compose
./podman-compose.sh

# View logs
./podman-compose.sh logs

# Stop services
./podman-compose.sh down

# Show status
./podman-compose.sh status
```

### Alternative: Docker Compose

```bash
# Start with docker-compose
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop
docker-compose down
```
